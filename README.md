**Task 1**: This program is used to create a collection and display each even element on the screen.\
The program contains two classes: ***CollectionCreating*** and ***Runner***.\
The class ***CollectionCreating*** contains two methods: ***createCollection*** and ***printEvenNumbers***.\
The method ***createCollection*** sets the size of the collection from the console and fills it with the numbers entered from the console.\
The method ***printEvenNumbers*** accepts the created collection as input and displays even numbers on the screen.
The class ***Runner*** is used to check the written code.

**Task 2**: This program is used to create a collection of shapes and display the perimeter of all shapes on the screen.\
The program contains 5 classes: ***Figure***, ***Circle***, ***Rectangle***, ***Triangle***  and ***Runner***.\
The class ***Figure*** is abstract class and used to create a common characteristic of all shapes and add a method ***calculatePerimeter*** to find the perimeter of the shapes.\
Classes ***Circle***, ***Rectangle***, ***Triangle*** extends from the class ***Figure***, a constructor has been created and the body of the method ***calculatePerimeter*** has been written.\
In the class ***Runner*** class objects are created , added to the collection, and the perimeter of each shape is displayed on the screen.

**Task 3**: The program is used to create a collection. The user enters the size of the collection from the console. The collection is filled with random values. The arithmetic mean is displayed on the screen.\
The program contains 4 classes: ***WrongSizeException***, ***SizeChecking***, ***CollectionCreating*** and ***Runner***. The class ***WrongSizeException*** contains an exception for the case when the user enters an incorrect size of collection.\
The class ***SizeChecking*** contains a method ***checkCollectionSize*** for checking the correctness of the input data. The class ***CollectionCreating*** contains 2 methods: ***createCollection*** and ***calculateArithmeticMean***.\
In the method ***createCollection*** the collection *numbers* is created . The user sets length of the collection from the console. The collection is filled with random integers in the range from 1 to 99.\
The method ***calculateArithmeticMean*** calculates the arithmetic mean of the elements of the collection. The class ***Runner*** is used to check the written code.

**Task 4**: The program is designed to create a collection of unique names of the group's students.\
The program contains 3 classes: ***Student***, ***Fabric*** and ***Runner***. The class ***Student*** is used to create a student. The class ***Fabric*** contains a method ***showInfo*** for creating objects of the class Student and adding them to a collection.\
The class ***Runner*** is used to check the written code.
