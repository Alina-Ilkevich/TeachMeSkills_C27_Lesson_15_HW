**Task 1**: This program is used to create a collection and display each even element on the screen.\
The program contains two classes: ***CollectionCreating*** and ***Runner***.\
The class ***CollectionCreating*** contains two methods: ***createCollection*** and ***printEvenNumbers***.\
The method ***createCollection*** sets the size of the collection from the console and fills it with the numbers entered from the console.\
The method ***printEvenNumbers*** accepts the created collection as input and displays even numbers on the screen.
The class ***Runner*** is used to check the written code.

**Task 2**: This program is used to create a collection of shapes and display the perimeter of all shapes on the screen.\
The program contains two classes: ***Figure***,***Circle***, ***Rectangle***, ***Triangle***  and ***Runner***.\
The class ***Figure*** is abstract class and used to create a common characteristic of all shapes and add a method ***calculatePerimeter*** to find the perimeter of the shapes.\
Classes ***Circle***, ***Rectangle***, ***Triangle*** extends from the class ***Figure***, a constructor has been created and the body of the method ***calculatePerimeter*** has been written.\
In the class ***Runner*** class objects are created , added to the collection, and the perimeter of each shape is displayed on the screen.

**Task 3**: The program is used to create a collection. The user enters the size of the collection from the console. The collection is filled with random values. The arithmetic mean is displayed on the screen.
